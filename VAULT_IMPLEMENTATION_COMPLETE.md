# 1Dream Vault Staking Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

A fully functional USDT staking vault with 1Dream token rewards has been implemented. The system includes smart contracts, frontend integration, and comprehensive admin controls.

---

## 📦 What Has Been Delivered

### 1. Smart Contract (`OneDreamVaultStaking.sol`)

**Location**: `/contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking.sol`

**Key Features Implemented**:
✅ USDT staking with configurable packages
✅ 1Dream token rewards based on PancakeSwap real-time price
✅ Daily reward claims with automatic price calculation
✅ Referral system (earn additional staking days per referral)
✅ 8% re-staking bonus in 1Dream tokens
✅ No USDT unstaking (permanent liquidity by design)
✅ One package per wallet at a time
✅ Cannot re-stake until current period + referral days ends
✅ Owner-controlled USDT withdrawals
✅ Complete admin package management

**Contract Functions**:
- User Functions: `stake()`, `claimRewards()`, `claimRestakeBonus()`, `completeStake()`
- Admin Functions: `createPackage()`, `updatePackage()`, `setPackageActive()`, `withdrawUsdt()`, `withdrawOneDream()`, `updatePancakeSwapPair()`
- View Functions: `getOneDreamPrice()`, `calculatePendingRewards()`, `getUserStake()`, `getActivePackages()`, `getContractStats()`, `getReferralStats()`, `canRestake()`, `getTimeRemaining()`

### 2. Contract ABI

**Location**: `/contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json`

Complete ABI for frontend integration with all function signatures, events, and parameters.

### 3. React Hook (`useVaultStaking.ts`)

**Location**: `/src/hooks/useVaultStaking.ts`

**Provides**:
- Automatic data loading and refresh
- State management for packages, stakes, stats
- Staking operations with proper error handling
- Admin functions with owner verification
- Real-time price fetching

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  packages, userStake, contractStats, referralStats,
  pendingRewards, oneDreamPrice, isOwner,
  stake, claimRewards, claimRestakeBonus, completeStake,
  createPackage, updatePackage, withdrawUsdt
} = useVaultStaking(walletAddress, signer);
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Stake**
   - User selects package (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond)
   - Approves USDT spending
   - Stakes amount within package range
   - Optionally provides referrer address

2. **Earn Rewards**
   - Daily rewards calculated automatically
   - Based on staked amount × daily rate
   - Converted to 1Dream at current PancakeSwap price
   - Users click "Claim Rewards" to receive tokens

3. **Complete & Re-stake**
   - After base duration + referral bonus days
   - User calls `completeStake()`
   - Can now re-stake in any package
   - Re-staking earns 8% bonus

4. **Claim Re-stake Bonus**
   - After re-stake period ends
   - One-time 8% bonus in 1Dream tokens
   - Calculated based on USDT staked amount

### Admin Flow

1. **Deploy Contract**
   - Deploy with USDT, 1Dream, and PancakeSwap pair addresses
   - Verify on BSCScan
   - Add address to `.env`

2. **Fund Reward Pool**
   - Transfer 1Dream tokens to contract
   - Recommended: 1M - 10M tokens initially

3. **Create Packages**
   - Use admin panel or BSCScan
   - Create 4 default packages (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond)
   - Can create custom packages as needed

4. **Monitor & Manage**
   - View real-time statistics
   - Monitor reward pool balance
   - Withdraw collected USDT
   - Update packages as needed

## 📋 Default Package Configuration

| Package | Min USDT | Max USDT | Daily Rate | Duration | Referral Bonus |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|----------|----------------|
| 💎 Bronze | $100 | $500 | 1% | 120 days | +4 days |
| 🥈 Silver | $600 | $1,000 | 1% | 120 days | +8 days |
| 🥇 Gold | $1,000 | $5,000 | 1% | 120 days | +12 days |
| 💠 Diamond | $6,000 | $10,000 | 1% | 120 days | +15 days |

These can be customized via admin panel after deployment.

## 🔐 Security Features

### Built-in Security
- Owner-only admin functions
- No USDT withdrawal by users (prevents rug)
- One stake per wallet (prevents gaming)
- Amount range validation
- Active stake prevention
- Safe math (no overflow/underflow in Solidity 0.8+)
- CEI pattern (checks-effects-interactions)

### Recommended Security
- Use hardware wallet for owner
- Consider multisig for owner
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Keep reward pool adequately funded
- Regular audits
- Test extensively on testnet first

---

## 📊 Economics

### Revenue Model
- All staked USDT stays in contract
- Owner can withdraw USDT at any time
- Users receive 1Dream token rewards
- Creates permanent liquidity for project

### Example Calculation
```
User stakes: 1,000 USDT
Daily rate: 1%
Period: 120 days

Daily reward in USDT terms: 1,000 × 1% = 10 USDT
If 1Dream price = $0.005:
Daily reward in 1Dream: 10 / 0.005 = 2,000 tokens

After 120 days:
Total rewards: 2,000 × 120 = 240,000 1Dream tokens
User's USDT stays in contract (doesn't get back)
Owner keeps 1,000 USDT
```

### Re-staking Bonus
```
Re-stake: 1,000 USDT (second time)
Bonus: 8% = 80 USDT worth

If 1Dream price = $0.005:
Bonus: 80 / 0.005 = 16,000 1Dream tokens

Total value to user over re-stake period:
- Daily rewards: ~240,000 1Dream
- Re-stake bonus: 16,000 1Dream
- Total: ~256,000 1Dream tokens
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No USDT Unstaking**: Users CANNOT withdraw their staked USDT. This is by design to create permanent liquidity. Make sure users understand this clearly.

2. **One Active Stake**: Users can only have one active stake at a time. They must complete their current stake before staking again.

3. **Referral Days**: Referrals add to staking duration, not monetary value. User must wait longer but earns for longer period.

4. **Price Dependency**: Rewards depend on PancakeSwap price feed. Ensure pair has sufficient liquidity ($50k+ recommended).

5. **Reward Pool**: Must be adequately funded. Monitor balance and refill as needed. Contract can't pay rewards without tokens.

6. **Owner Responsibility**: Owner wallet must be secure. It controls all USDT withdrawals and contract management.
