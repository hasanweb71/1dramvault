# Vault Staking V2 - Updates Complete

## Overview
Successfully updated the Vault Staking smart contract and frontend to address all requested requirements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Closing Bonus → Re-staking Bonus Terminology ✅

**Smart Contract Changes:**
- Renamed `closingBonusBasisPoints` to `restakingBonusBasisPoints` in `StakingPackage` struct
- Removed `closingBonus` and `closingBonusClaimed` fields from `UserStake` struct
- Removed `claimClosingBonus()` function entirely
- Removed `ClosingBonusClaimed` event
- Updated `claimRestakeBonus()` to use package-based bonus rate instead of hardcoded 8%
- Updated all function signatures for `createPackage()` and `updatePackage()`

**Frontend Changes:**
- Updated `useVaultStaking.ts` hook interface to use `restakingBonusBasisPoints`
- Updated `Defi.tsx` to show "Re-staking Bonus" instead of "Closing Bonus"
- Updated `VaultAdminPanel.tsx` form labels and fields
- Updated all package card displays

### 2. Package Name and Duration Display ✅

**Smart Contract Changes:**
- Modified `getUserStakeBasic()` to return package name as 6th parameter
- Package name is fetched from the user's active package

**Frontend Changes:**
- Added `packageName` field to `UserStake` interface
- Updated "Your Statistics" section to show:
  - **Rank/Package**: Displays the package name (e.g., "Bronze", "Silver", "Gold", "Diamond")
  - **Duration**: Shows base duration with referral bonus separately
    - Format: "120 days (+12 bonus)" if user has referrals
    - Shows only base days if no referrals

### 3. Fixed Rewards Calculation ✅

**Smart Contract Changes:**
- Rewards calculation already correctly implements 1% daily in 1DREAM tokens
- Formula: `(USDT staked × daily rate% × days elapsed) / current 1DREAM price`
- Price fetched from PancakeSwap pair in real-time
- Properly handles decimal conversions for USDT and 1DREAM tokens

**No changes needed** - calculation was already correct in the contract.

### 4. 24-Hour Claim Restriction ✅

**Smart Contract Changes:**
- Added 24-hour cooldown to `claimRewards()` function
- Check: `require(block.timestamp >= userStake.lastClaimTime + 1 days, "Can only claim once every 24 hours")`
- Users can only claim rewards once per day

**Frontend Changes:**
- `canClaim()` function checks if 24 hours have passed
- "See Rewards" button fetches live price and calculates rewards
- "Claim" button only appears after clicking "See Rewards"
- Claim button is disabled if less than 24 hours since last claim
- Shows helpful message: "You can claim rewards every 24 hours"

## Updated User Statistics Display

The "Your Statistics" section now shows:

```
Your Statistics
├─ Total Staked: 100.00 USDT
├─ Pending Rewards: [Click to view] → See Rewards button
├─ Rank/Package: Gold
├─ Duration: 120 days (+8 bonus)
├─ Re-staking Bonus: 0.0000 1DREAM
└─ Referrals: 2
```

## Rewards Flow

1. User clicks "See Rewards" button
2. Loading animation appears
3. System fetches current 1DREAM/USDT price from PancakeSwap
4. Calculates rewards: (staked amount × 1% daily × days since last claim) / 1DREAM price
5. Displays calculated rewards in 1DREAM tokens
6. "Claim" button appears
7. User clicks "Claim" (only available if 24 hours passed)
8. Rewards transferred to user's wallet
9. `lastClaimTime` updated to current timestamp

## Important Notes for Deployment

### ⚠️ ABI File Must Be Regenerated
The smart contract structure has changed significantly. You MUST:

1. Deploy the new contract version
2. Generate new ABI file (see `contracts/ABI_UPDATE_REQUIRED.md`)
3. Replace `contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json` with new ABI
4. Update `.env` with new contract address: `VITE_VAULT_STAKING_CONTRACT=<address>`

### Migration Considerations
- Old contract and new contract are NOT compatible
- Existing stakes will remain on old contract
- Users will need to complete their stakes on old contract before staking in new contract
- Consider announcing the migration to users
