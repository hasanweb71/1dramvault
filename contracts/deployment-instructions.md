# ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions for OneDreamStaking V2

## Contract Deployment Complete âœ…

Since you've already deployed the contract, follow these steps to complete the setup:

## Step 1: Update Contract Address in Frontend

**CRITICAL**: You must update the contract address in two files:

### File 1: `src/hooks/useStakingData.ts`
```typescript
// Line 141: Replace with your deployed contract address
const STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';
```

### File 2: `src/hooks/useReferralData.ts`
```typescript
// Line 7: Replace with your deployed contract address
const STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';
```

## Step 2: Initialize Staking Plans

After deployment, you need to add the 3 staking plans. Use these exact parameters:

### Plan 1: Flexible Staking
```javascript
await contract.addStakingPlan(
    "Flexible Staking",
    600,  // 6% APY (600 basis points)
    0,    // No lock period
    0,    // No early unstake fee
    ethers.parseEther("100"), // Min 100 1DREAM
    true  // Active
);
```

### Plan 2: 90 Days Lock
```javascript
await contract.addStakingPlan(
    "90 Days Lock",
    2500, // 25% APY (2500 basis points)
    7776000, // 90 days in seconds (90 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    1200, // 12% early unstake fee (1200 basis points)
    ethers.parseEther("100"), // Min 100 1DREAM
    true  // Active
);
```

### Plan 3: 180 Days Lock
```javascript
await contract.addStakingPlan(
    "180 Days Lock",
    3800, // 38% APY (3800 basis points)
    15552000, // 180 days in seconds (180 * 24 * 60 * 60)
    1200, // 12% early unstake fee (1200 basis points)
    ethers.parseEther("100"), // Min 100 1DREAM
    true  // Active
);
```

## Step 3: Fund Contract with Reward Pool

**IMPORTANT**: Account for 1DREAM token transaction taxes when funding!

```javascript
// Example: If you want 100,000 1DREAM in the contract
// And 1DREAM has 4% transaction tax
// You need to send: 100,000 / (1 - 0.04) = 104,167 tokens

const fundingAmount = ethers.parseEther("104167"); // Adjust based on your needs
await oneDreamToken.transfer(contractAddress, fundingAmount);

// Verify contract balance
const balance = await contract.getContractTokenBalance();
console.log("Contract balance:", ethers.formatEther(balance));
```

## Step 4: Verify Contract Setup

Check that everything is configured correctly:

```javascript
// Check plans
const plans = await contract.getActiveStakingPlans();
console.log("Active plans:", plans.length); // Should be 3

// Check commission
const commission = await contract.referralCommissionBasisPoints();
console.log("Commission:", commission.toString()); // Should be 500 (5%)

// Check balance
const balance = await contract.getContractTokenBalance();
console.log("Contract balance:", ethers.formatEther(balance));
```

## Step 5: Test Frontend Integration

1. **Update Contract Addresses**: Replace placeholder addresses in both hooks
2. **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Test Wallet Connection**: Connect your wallet
4. **Test Staking Plans**: Verify all 3 plans display correctly
5. **Test Staking Flow**: Approve and stake tokens
6. **Test Referral System**: Generate referral link, verify commission shows as single percentage
7. **Test Admin Panel**: If you're the owner, verify commission update form works

## Step 6: Production Deployment

Once everything works locally:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy dist/ folder to your hosting platform
```

## Expected Plan Display

After setup, your staking plans should show:

| Plan | APY | Lock Period | Min Stake | Early Fee |
|------|-----|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Flexible Staking | 6% | No Lock | 100 1DREAM | N/A |
| 90 Days Lock | 25% | 90 Days | 100 1DREAM | 12% |
| 180 Days Lock | 38% | 180 Days | 100 1DREAM | 12% |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Contract not found" error
**Solution**: Verify you've updated both hook files with the correct contract address

### Issue: Plans not displaying
**Solution**: Ensure you've added the 3 staking plans using the exact parameters above

### Issue: Referral commission shows 0%
**Solution**: Check that `referralCommissionBasisPoints` is set to 500 in the contract

### Issue: Contract balance shows 0
**Solution**: Fund the contract with 1DREAM tokens, accounting for transaction taxes
