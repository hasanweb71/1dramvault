# How to Get the New ABI from Remix

After successfully compiling the fixed contract in Remix IDE, follow these steps to get the new ABI:

## Step 1: Compile the Contract

1. Open Remix IDE
2. Create new file: `OneDreamVaultStaking.sol`
3. Paste the updated contract code
4. Go to "Solidity Compiler" tab (left sidebar)
5. Settings:
   - Compiler: `0.8.20+`
   - Optimization: **Enabled** (200 runs)
6. Click "Compile OneDreamVaultStaking.sol"
7. âœ… Should compile successfully without errors!

## Step 2: Copy the ABI

### Method 1: From Compilation Tab
1. After successful compilation
2. Scroll down in compiler tab
3. Find "Compilation Details" button
4. Click it
5. Find "ABI" section
6. Click the copy icon ðŸ“‹

### Method 2: From Contract Tab
1. Go to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
2. Under "CONTRACT" dropdown
3. Click the small copy icon next to contract name
4. Select "ABI" from the popup

### Method 3: Manual Copy
1. After compilation, look for the "Contract" section
2. Click on "ABI" button
3. The ABI will display in JSON format
4. Select all and copy

## Step 3: Replace the ABI File

1. Open `/contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json`
2. Delete all existing content
3. Paste the new ABI copied from Remix
4. Save the file

## Step 4: Verify the Changes

Check that these new functions exist in the ABI:

```bash
grep "getUserStakeBasic" contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json
grep "getUserStakeDuration" contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json
grep "getUserStakeBonus" contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json
```

All three should return results.

Also verify the old function is gone:
```bash
grep "getUserStake\"" contracts/OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json
```

Should only show the three new functions, not the old single `getUserStake`.

## Step 5: Test the Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Connect wallet and check that:
- âœ… Contract stats load
- âœ… Packages display
- âœ… User stake info shows (if user has staked)
- âœ… No console errors

## What Changed in the ABI?

### Removed
```json
{
  "name": "getUserStake",
  "outputs": [
    // 12 return values - caused stack depth error
  ]
}
```

### Added
```json
{
  "name": "getUserStakeBasic",
  "outputs": [
    { "name": "packageId", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "usdtAmount", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "startTime", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "lastClaimTime", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "isActive", "type": "bool" }
  ]
},
{
  "name": "getUserStakeDuration",
  "outputs": [
    { "name": "baseDurationDays", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "totalDurationDays", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "referralCount", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "restakeCount", "type": "uint256" }
  ]
},
{
  "name": "getUserStakeBonus",
  "outputs": [
    { "name": "restakeBonus", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "restakeBonusClaimed", "type": "bool" },
    { "name": "referrer", "type": "address" }
  ]
}
```

## Quick Alternative: Use TypeChain

If you have TypeChain installed:

```bash
# Generate types from ABI
npx typechain --target ethers-v6 --out-dir src/types contracts/*.json
```

This will auto-generate TypeScript types from your ABI.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Can't find ABI button in Remix
- Solution: Make sure compilation was successful first

**Issue**: ABI looks wrong or incomplete
- Solution: Recompile with optimization enabled

**Issue**: Frontend shows "function not found" errors
- Solution: Clear browser cache and restart dev server

**Issue**: Old ABI still being used
- Solution: Delete `node_modules/.vite` cache folder

## Summary

```
1. âœ… Compile fixed contract in Remix
2. âœ… Copy ABI from Remix
3. âœ… Replace OneDreamVaultStaking_ABI.json
4. âœ… Verify new functions exist
5. âœ… Test frontend integration
```

That's it! Your contract is now ready for deployment with the stack depth issue fixed.

**Note**: The React hook has already been updated to work with the 3 new functions, so no frontend code changes are needed beyond replacing the ABI file.
