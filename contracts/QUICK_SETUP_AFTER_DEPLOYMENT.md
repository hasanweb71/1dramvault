# Quick Setup After Contract Deployment

## Step 1: Add Contract Address to Environment

After deploying the contract, add the address to your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_VAULT_STAKING_CONTRACT=0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## Step 2: Fund the Reward Pool

Transfer 1Dream tokens to the contract address for user rewards:

**Recommended Initial Amount:** 1,000,000 - 10,000,000 1Dream tokens

Simply send tokens to the contract address from your wallet or DEX.

## Step 3: Create Staking Packages

Use the admin panel or call the contract directly to create packages.

### Using Admin Panel (Easiest Way):

1. Go to your application
2. Navigate to Admin Panel
3. Connect owner wallet
4. Click "Add Package"
5. Fill in details for each tier:

**Bronze Package:**
- Name: `Bronze`
- Min Amount: `100`
- Max Amount: `500`
- Daily Rate: `1` (%)
- Base Duration: `120` (days)
- Referral Bonus: `4` (days)

**Silver Package:**
- Name: `Silver`
- Min Amount: `600`
- Max Amount: `1000`
- Daily Rate: `1` (%)
- Base Duration: `120` (days)
- Referral Bonus: `8` (days)

**Gold Package:**
- Name: `Gold`
- Min Amount: `1000`
- Max Amount: `5000`
- Daily Rate: `1` (%)
- Base Duration: `120` (days)
- Referral Bonus: `12` (days)

**Diamond Package:**
- Name: `Diamond`
- Min Amount: `6000`
- Max Amount: `10000`
- Daily Rate: `1` (%)
- Base Duration: `120` (days)
- Referral Bonus: `15` (days)

### Using Contract Directly (Advanced):

If admin panel isn't working, use BSCScan:

1. Go to BSCScan > Your Contract > Write Contract
2. Connect wallet
3. Find `createPackage` function
4. For each package, enter:

```solidity
// Bronze
createPackage(
  "Bronze",
  "100000000000000000000",      // 100 USDT (18 decimals)
  "500000000000000000000",      // 500 USDT
  100,                          // 1% daily
  120,                          // 120 days
  4                             // 4 days per referral
)

// Silver
createPackage(
  "Silver",
  "600000000000000000000",
  "1000000000000000000000",
  100,
  120,
  8
)

// Gold
createPackage(
  "Gold",
  "1000000000000000000000",
  "5000000000000000000000",
  100,
  120,
  12
)

// Diamond
createPackage(
  "Diamond",
  "6000000000000000000000",
  "10000000000000000000000",
  100,
  120,
  15
)
```

## Step 4: Verify Everything Works

1. **Check packages are created:**
   - Call `getActivePackages()` on BSCScan Read Contract
   - Or check admin panel

2. **Verify reward pool:**
   - Call `getContractStats()` to see OneDream balance
   - Ensure sufficient tokens for rewards

3. **Test price feed:**
   - Call `getOneDreamPrice()`
   - Should return non-zero value from PancakeSwap

4. **Test with small stake:**
   - Use a test wallet
   - Stake minimum amount ($100 USDT)
   - Verify transaction succeeds
   - Check user can see stake details

## Step 5: Launch Checklist

```
âœ… Contract deployed and verified on BSCScan
âœ… Contract address added to .env
âœ… Reward pool funded with 1Dream tokens
âœ… All 4 packages created (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond)
âœ… Price feed working (returns valid price)
âœ… Test stake completed successfully
âœ… Admin panel accessible by owner
âœ… User interface displaying packages correctly
âœ… Monitoring setup in place
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Contract not deployed yet" error

**Solution:**
- Ensure `VITE_VAULT_STAKING_CONTRACT` is set in `.env`
- Restart dev server after adding env variable
- Check address is correct (no typos, proper format)

### Issue: Packages not showing

**Solution:**
- Verify packages were created (check BSCScan events)
- Call `getPackageCount()` - should return 4
- Refresh page or click refresh button
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Price returns 0

**Solution:**
- Verify PancakeSwap pair has liquidity
- Check pair address is correct in contract
- Ensure pair is 1Dream/USDT (not another pair)
- Add more liquidity if needed ($10k+ recommended)

### Issue: Admin panel shows "Access Denied"

**Solution:**
- Verify you're connected with owner wallet
- Call `owner()` function to confirm owner address
- Check you're on correct network (BSC Mainnet)

### Issue: Staking fails

**Solution:**
- Ensure user has approved USDT first
- Check amount is within package min/max range
- Verify user doesn't have active stake already
- Check package is active
- Ensure sufficient gas

## Monitoring Dashboard

Monitor these metrics regularly:

1. **Contract Balance**
   - USDT: Should increase as users stake
   - 1Dream: Should decrease as rewards claimed
   - Alert if reward pool < 100,000 tokens

2. **User Activity**
   - Total stakers
   - Total staked amount
   - Rewards claimed daily

3. **Package Performance**
   - Which packages are most popular
   - Average stake amount per package
   - Referral activity per package

4. **Price Feed**
   - 1Dream price from PancakeSwap
   - Ensure price is stable and realistic
   - Monitor for manipulation attempts

## Refilling Reward Pool

When reward pool is low:

1. Calculate needed amount based on active stakes
2. Transfer 1Dream tokens to contract address
3. Verify balance updated: `getContractStats()`
4. No contract function needed - just send tokens

## Emergency Procedures

### If price feed breaks:

```solidity
// Update to new PancakeSwap pair
updatePancakeSwapPair(newPairAddress)
```

### If need to pause (no native pause):

- Set all packages to inactive:
```solidity
setPackageActive(1, false)
setPackageActive(2, false)
setPackageActive(3, false)
setPackageActive(4, false)
```

### If need to withdraw USDT:

```solidity
// Withdraw specific amount
withdrawUsdt(amountInWei)

// Example: Withdraw 1000 USDT
withdrawUsdt("1000000000000000000000")
```

## Support Contacts

Keep these handy:
- Contract Address: `[Add after deployment]`
- Owner Wallet: `[Your wallet address]`
- PancakeSwap Pair: `[Pair address]`
- Deployment Date: `[Date]`
- Initial Funding: `[Amount of 1Dream]`

## Next Steps

After successful launch:

1. **Week 1:** Monitor closely, be ready to adjust
2. **Week 2-4:** Analyze user behavior, optimize packages
3. **Month 2:** Consider adding new packages based on demand
4. **Ongoing:** Regular refills, monitoring, community updates

Remember: Users can't unstake USDT - this is by design. Only owner can withdraw USDT from contract.

Good luck with your launch! ðŸš€
