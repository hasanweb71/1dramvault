# OneDream Vault Staking - Complete Deployment Guide

## Overview
This smart contract implements a USDT staking vault that rewards users with 1Dream tokens based on real-time PancakeSwap prices.

### Key Features
âœ… **USDT Staking** - Users stake USDT and earn 1Dream token rewards
âœ… **PancakeSwap Price Integration** - Rewards calculated using live 1Dream price
âœ… **Daily Rewards** - Users claim rewards daily based on package rate
âœ… **Referral System** - Earn additional staking days for each successful referral
âœ… **Re-staking Bonus** - 8% bonus in 1Dream tokens for re-staking
âœ… **No USDT Unstaking** - All USDT stays in contract (owner controlled)
âœ… **One Package Per Wallet** - Cannot re-stake until current period ends
âœ… **Full Admin Control** - Manage packages, referrals, and withdrawals

## Contract Addresses Required for Deployment

You will need the following addresses on BSC Mainnet:

1. **USDT Token Address (BSC)**
   `0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955`

2. **1Dream Token Address**
   `YOUR_1DREAM_TOKEN_ADDRESS` (replace with actual deployed token)

3. **PancakeSwap V2 Pair Address (1Dream/USDT)**
   You need to create a liquidity pair on PancakeSwap first:
   - Go to PancakeSwap
   - Create 1Dream/USDT pair
   - Add liquidity
   - Get the pair address from BSCScan

---

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Create PancakeSwap Liquidity Pair
```
âœ… Create 1Dream/USDT pair on PancakeSwap V2
âœ… Add initial liquidity (recommended: $10,000+ for accurate pricing)
âœ… Get pair contract address from BSCScan
âœ… Verify pair is active and trading
```

### 2. Prepare Contract Owner Wallet
```
âœ… Have sufficient BNB for deployment gas (~0.05 BNB)
âœ… Have 1Dream tokens ready to fund reward pool
âœ… Wallet should be secure multisig or hardware wallet
âœ… Note down owner address for admin access
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Contract

Use Remix, Hardhat, or any Solidity deployment tool.

**Constructor Parameters:**
```solidity
_usdtToken: 0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955
_oneDreamToken: YOUR_1DREAM_TOKEN_ADDRESS
_pancakeSwapPair: YOUR_PANCAKESWAP_PAIR_ADDRESS
```

**Example using Remix:**
1. Open Remix IDE
2. Create new file: `OneDreamVaultStaking.sol`
3. Paste contract code
4. Select compiler version: `0.8.20` or higher
5. Compile contract
6. Switch to "Deploy & Run Transactions"
7. Select "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
8. Connect wallet to BSC Mainnet
9. Enter constructor parameters
10. Deploy and confirm transaction

### Step 2: Verify Contract on BSCScan

1. Go to BSCScan
2. Find your deployed contract
3. Click "Contract" > "Verify and Publish"
4. Select:
   - Compiler: `v0.8.20+`
   - Optimization: Yes (200 runs)
   - License: MIT
5. Paste contract source code
6. Verify

### Step 3: Fund Reward Pool

Transfer 1Dream tokens to contract for rewards:

```javascript
// Recommended initial funding: 10,000,000 1Dream tokens
// This depends on your expected staking volume
```

Use the contract address to send 1Dream tokens directly.

### Step 4: Create Initial Staking Packages

Call `createPackage` function for each tier:

#### Bronze Package
```javascript
createPackage(
  "Bronze",                    // name
  100000000000000000000,       // minAmount: 100 USDT (18 decimals)
  500000000000000000000,       // maxAmount: 500 USDT (18 decimals)
  100,                         // dailyRateBasisPoints: 1% (100 BP)
  120,                         // baseDurationDays: 120 days
  4                            // referralBonusDays: 4 days per referral
)
```

#### Silver Package
```javascript
createPackage(
  "Silver",                    // name
  600000000000000000000,       // minAmount: 600 USDT
  1000000000000000000000,      // maxAmount: 1000 USDT
  100,                         // dailyRateBasisPoints: 1%
  120,                         // baseDurationDays: 120 days
  8                            // referralBonusDays: 8 days per referral
)
```

#### Gold Package
```javascript
createPackage(
  "Gold",                      // name
  1000000000000000000000,      // minAmount: 1000 USDT
  5000000000000000000000,      // maxAmount: 5000 USDT
  100,                         // dailyRateBasisPoints: 1%
  120,                         // baseDurationDays: 120 days
  12                           // referralBonusDays: 12 days per referral
)
```

#### Diamond Package
```javascript
createPackage(
  "Diamond",                   // name
  6000000000000000000000,      // minAmount: 6000 USDT
  10000000000000000000000,     // maxAmount: 10000 USDT
  100,                         // dailyRateBasisPoints: 1%
  120,                         // baseDurationDays: 120 days
  15                           // referralBonusDays: 15 days per referral
)
```

**Note:** USDT on BSC uses 18 decimals, so multiply amounts by 10^18

### Step 5: Test Contract Functions

Before going live, test:

```javascript
// 1. Check package was created
getPackage(1) // Should return Bronze package details

// 2. Check price feed works
getOneDreamPrice() // Should return current price from PancakeSwap

// 3. Check contract stats
getContractStats() // Should show 0 stakers, correct balances
```

---

## Frontend Integration

Add contract address to your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_VAULT_STAKING_CONTRACT=YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

The frontend will automatically:
- Load packages from contract
- Display real-time stats
- Enable staking functionality
- Show admin panel for contract owner

---

## Admin Functions Guide

### Package Management

**Create Package:**
```solidity
createPackage(name, minAmount, maxAmount, dailyRate, baseDuration, referralBonus)
```

**Update Package:**
```solidity
updatePackage(packageId, name, minAmount, maxAmount, dailyRate, baseDuration, referralBonus, active)
```

**Toggle Package Status:**
```solidity
setPackageActive(packageId, true/false)
```

### Financial Management

**Withdraw USDT (Owner Only):**
```solidity
withdrawUsdt(amount) // Amount in wei (with 18 decimals)
```

**Withdraw 1Dream (Owner Only - Emergency):**
```solidity
withdrawOneDream(amount) // Amount in wei (with token decimals)
```

### Price Feed Management

**Update PancakeSwap Pair (if needed):**
```solidity
updatePancakeSwapPair(newPairAddress)
```

---

## User Flow

### Staking Process

1. **User approves USDT:**
   ```javascript
   await usdtToken.approve(contractAddress, amount)
   ```

2. **User stakes:**
   ```javascript
   await contract.stake(packageId, usdtAmount, referrerAddress)
   ```

3. **User claims rewards daily:**
   ```javascript
   await contract.claimRewards()
   ```

4. **After period ends, complete stake:**
   ```javascript
   await contract.completeStake()
   ```

5. **User can then re-stake (gets 8% bonus):**
   ```javascript
   await contract.stake(packageId, usdtAmount, referrerAddress)
   ```

6. **After re-stake period, claim bonus:**
   ```javascript
   await contract.claimRestakeBonus()
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Owner Security
- Use hardware wallet or multisig for owner address
- Never share private keys
- Test all admin functions on testnet first

### Contract Security
- Contract has been audited (recommended before mainnet)
- All USDT deposits are locked until owner withdrawal
- Rewards pool should be monitored and refilled regularly

### Price Oracle Security
- PancakeSwap pair should have sufficient liquidity ($50k+ recommended)
- Monitor for price manipulation
- Consider adding price sanity checks

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
- Monitor reward pool balance
- Check for stuck transactions
- Verify price feed accuracy

### Weekly Tasks
- Review referral activity
- Check total staked amounts
- Analyze package popularity

### Monthly Tasks
- Refill reward pool if needed
- Review and adjust packages
- Generate usage reports

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Price returns 0**
- Check PancakeSwap pair has liquidity
- Verify pair address is correct
- Ensure pair is 1Dream/USDT (not other pair)

**Issue: Rewards calculation wrong**
- Check token decimals match (USDT 18, verify 1Dream decimals)
- Verify daily rate basis points (1% = 100 BP)
- Check user's lastClaimTime

**Issue: User can't stake**
- Verify user has approved USDT
- Check user doesn't have active stake
- Verify package is active
- Check amount is within min/max range

**Issue: Admin functions don't work**
- Verify you're calling from owner wallet
- Check wallet is connected to correct network
- Confirm gas limit is sufficient
