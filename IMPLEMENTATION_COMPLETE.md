## What Needs To Be Done Before Launch

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Deployment (Required)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: These steps must be completed before frontend can work**

1. **Compile Contract**
   ```bash
   cd contracts/
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy to BSC Testnet**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet
   ```
   - Save the deployed contract address
   - Verify on BSCscan testnet

3. **Test on Testnet**
   - Stake with referral code
   - Claim rewards
   - Claim referral bonus
   - Test admin functions
   - Verify all calculations correct

4. **Deploy to BSC Mainnet**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bsc
   ```
   - Save the deployed contract address
   - Verify on BSCscan mainnet

5. **Initialize Contract**
   - Add staking plans (3 recommended: Flexible, 90 Days, 180 Days)
   - Fund contract with initial reward pool (e.g., 100,000 1DREAM)
   - Verify commission rate (should be 500 basis points = 5%)

### Phase 2: Frontend Configuration (Required)

**⚠️ Only after contract deployment**

Update these files with the **new V2 contract address**:

1. **File:** `src/hooks/useStakingData.ts`
   - Line 141: Update `STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
   - Replace `STAKING_CONTRACT_ABI` with contents from `contracts/OneDreamStakingV2_ABI.json`

2. **File:** `src/hooks/useReferralData.ts`
   - Line 7: Update `STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
   - Replace `STAKING_CONTRACT_ABI` with contents from `contracts/OneDreamStakingV2_ABI.json`

### Phase 3: Database Migration (Required)

**⚠️ Backup database first**

```bash
# Apply migration
supabase db push

# Or manually via Supabase dashboard:
# Run: supabase/migrations/20250930120000_simplify_referral_system_v2.sql
```

Verify:
- `referral_config` table exists
- Default rate (500) inserted
- `current_referral_rate` view works

### Phase 4: Frontend Code Updates (Optional but Recommended)

The current frontend will work with the new contract, but to fully utilize V2 features and remove deprecated UI, update:

1. **Simplified Referral Display** (Dapps.tsx)
   - Remove tier display grid (lines 798-833)
   - Add single commission display
   - See detailed changes in README_V2_MIGRATION.md

2. **Admin Panel Updates** (AdminPanel.tsx)
   - Remove tier management section (lines 609-676)
   - Add commission adjustment form
   - See detailed changes in README_V2_MIGRATION.md

3. **Hook Simplification** (useStakingData.ts, useReferralData.ts)
   - Remove tier-related functions
   - Add commission fetch/update functions
   - See detailed changes in README_V2_MIGRATION.md

### Phase 5: Testing (Critical)

Run through complete testing checklist in `/contracts/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`:

**Smart Contract Tests:**
- [ ] All admin functions
- [ ] All user functions
- [ ] All view functions

**Frontend Tests:**
- [ ] Wallet connection
- [ ] Staking flow
- [ ] Reward claims
- [ ] Referral bonus claims
- [ ] Admin panel (if owner)

**Database Tests:**
- [ ] Data syncing
- [ ] Commission tracking
- [ ] Historical data

### Phase 6: Deployment (Final)

1. **Build Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**
   - Upload `dist/` folder to hosting
   - Verify production deployment

3. **Monitor**
   - Watch contract on BSCscan
   - Monitor for any reverted transactions
   - Check error logs
   - Gather user feedback

## Key Improvements in V2

### 1. Simplified Referral System
**Before (V1):**
- 5 different tier levels
- Complex tier qualification logic
- Different commission rates per tier
- Difficult to understand for users

**After (V2):**
- Single direct 5% commission
- Same rate for all referrals
- Admin can adjust anytime
- Clear and simple for users

### 2. Better Commission Management
**V1:** Fixed tiers, required contract upgrade to change
**V2:** Admin can update commission with single transaction

### 3. Cleaner Codebase
- Removed ~200 lines of tier logic
- Simplified bonus calculations
- Easier to maintain and audit
- Fewer potential bugs

### 4. Database Efficiency
- Single commission config instead of tier array
- Historical tracking of rate changes
- Faster queries (no tier matching needed)

### 5. User Experience
- Easier to understand "5% on all referrals"
- No confusion about tier levels
- Transparent and fair system
- Predictable earnings

## Important Notes

### 1. Tax Handling for 1DREAM Token

The 1DREAM token has transaction fees/taxes. The V2 contract handles this by:

**Approach:** Contract balance distribution
- Admin funds the contract with 1DREAM tokens
- Rewards distributed from contract balance
- Admin must account for taxes when funding

**Admin Responsibility:**
- Monitor contract balance regularly
- Fund contract with extra tokens to cover taxes
- Example: If 10,000 needed for rewards, fund with 11,000+ to cover tax

**Formula:**
```
Required Funding = Estimated Rewards / (1 - Tax Rate)
Example: 10,000 / (1 - 0.05) = 10,526 tokens
```

### 2. Migration from V1

**No automatic migration** of existing stakes. Users have two options:

**Option A - Keep V1 Stakes:**
- Existing V1 stakes remain on V1 contract
- Users can continue claiming rewards on V1
- Users can unstake from V1 anytime

**Option B - Manual Migration:**
- Users unstake from V1
- Users stake on V2 with same or different plan
- Fresh stake start time on V2

**Recommendation:** Announce V2 but keep V1 active for 30-60 days to allow gradual migration.

### 3. Referral Commission Changes

When admin updates commission:
- **New stakes:** Use new commission rate
- **Existing unclaimed bonuses:** Still calculated at old rate (when stake was created)
- **Frontend:** Should fetch current rate from contract for new stakes

### 4. Contract Security

The V2 contract includes:
- ✅ Owner-only functions with `onlyOwner` modifier
- ✅ Input validation on all parameters
- ✅ Safe math (Solidity 0.8+)
- ✅ Reentrancy protection via CEI pattern
- ✅ Emergency withdrawal for admin
- ✅ No proxy/upgrade pattern (deploy new if needed)

**Recommendation:** Get professional audit before mainnet deployment if handling significant value.
