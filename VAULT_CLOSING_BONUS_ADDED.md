# Vault Staking Closing Bonus Feature - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully added a closing bonus feature to the vault staking system and fixed the admin panel access to show for both DApps and Vault contract owners.

## Changes Made

### 1. Smart Contract Updates (OneDreamVaultStaking.sol)

#### New Fields Added:
- **StakingPackage struct**: Added `closingBonusBasisPoints` field to store the closing bonus percentage for each package
- **UserStake struct**: Added `closingBonus` and `closingBonusClaimed` fields to track user's closing bonus

#### New Functions:
- **claimClosingBonus()**: Allows users to claim their closing bonus after the staking period ends
  - Calculates bonus based on package's `closingBonusBasisPoints`
  - Converts USDT value to 1Dream tokens based on current PancakeSwap price
  - Only claimable after staking period ends

#### Updated Functions:

- **updatePackage()**: Now includes `_closingBonusBasisPoints` parameter
- **stake()**: Initializes closing bonus fields when creating a new stake
- **getUserStakeBonus()**: Returns both restake bonus and closing bonus information

#### Closing Bonus Rates by Package:
- **Bronze**: 5% (500 basis points)
- **Silver**: 8% (800 basis points)
- **Gold**: 12% (1200 basis points)
- **Diamond**: 16% (1600 basis points)

### 2. Frontend Hook Updates (useVaultStaking.ts)

- **updatePackage()**: Accepts `closingBonusBP` parameter

### 3. Admin Panel Updates (VaultAdminPanel.tsx)

#### Form Updates:
- Added "Closing Bonus (%)" field to package creation/edit form
- Default value: 5%
- Range: 0-20%

#### Display Updates:
- Added "Closing Bonus" column to the packages table
- Shows closing bonus rate for each package (e.g., "5%", "8%")

### 4. Admin Panel Access Fix (App.tsx)

#### Multi-Contract Owner Support:
- Now checks ownership for both DApps staking contract AND Vault staking contract
- Shows admin panel if user is owner of EITHER contract
- Displays separate admin panels for each contract the user owns
- If user owns both contracts, both admin panels are shown

#### State Management:
- Added `isDappsOwner` state
- Added `isVaultOwner` state
- `isOwner` is now true if user owns either contract

#### Admin Panel Layout:
```
If DApps Owner:
  - "DApps Staking Admin" section with AdminPanel component

If Vault Owner:
  - "Vault Staking Admin" section with VaultAdminPanel component

If Both:
  - Both sections shown

If Neither:
  - Access denied message
```

## How to Deploy

### 1. Deploy the Updated Smart Contract

Deploy the updated `OneDreamVaultStaking.sol` contract with these constructor parameters:
- USDT Token Address
- OneDream Token Address
- PancakeSwap Pair Address

### 2. Create Packages with Closing Bonus

After deployment, create packages using the admin panel with appropriate closing bonus rates:

```javascript
// Example: Create Bronze Package
createPackage(
  "Bronze",           // name
  "100",             // minAmount (100 USDT)
  "500",             // maxAmount (500 USDT)
  100,               // dailyRateBasisPoints (1%)
  120,               // baseDurationDays (120 days)
  4,                 // referralBonusDays (4 days per referral)
  500                // closingBonusBasisPoints (5%)
)
```

### 3. Update the Contract Address

After deployment, provide the new contract address to update in `.env`:

```
VITE_VAULT_STAKING_CONTRACT=0xYourNewContractAddress
```

## User Flow

1. **Staking**: User stakes USDT in a package (closing bonus fields initialized)
2. **Earning**: User earns daily rewards (1% per day in 1Dream tokens)
3. **Period Ends**: After the staking duration completes
4. **Claim Closing Bonus**: User can claim their closing bonus (5-16% of USDT stake value in 1Dream tokens)
5. **Claim Restake Bonus**: If re-staking, user can also claim 8% re-stake bonus
6. **Complete Stake**: User completes stake to enable re-staking

## Key Features

- **Fixed Percentage Bonus**: Closing bonus is a fixed % of the staked USDT amount
- **Package-Based Rates**: Each package has its own closing bonus rate
- **One-Time Claim**: Closing bonus can only be claimed once per stake
- **End-of-Period Only**: Bonus is only claimable after staking period ends
- **1Dream Token Payout**: Bonus is paid in 1Dream tokens based on current price
- **Independent from Restake Bonus**: Closing bonus is separate from the 8% restake bonus

## Admin Benefits

- **Flexible Bonus Rates**: Can set different closing bonus rates for each package
- **User Incentive**: Encourages users to complete full staking periods
- **Easy Management**: Simple percentage-based calculation
- **Contract Safety**: Max 20% closing bonus to prevent excessive payouts

## Security Notes

- Closing bonus requires active stake
- Can only claim after period ends
- Cannot claim twice
- Requires sufficient 1Dream tokens in contract
- Uses PancakeSwap for price oracle
- Package closing bonus must be ≤ 20%
