### 4. Code Improvements
- **Simplified event processing:** V3 emits `stakeIndex` directly in Staked events
- **Better referral tracking:** No need to calculate stake index manually
- **More reliable:** Direct access to stake index eliminates calculation errors

## 🔑 Key V3 Features Now Active

### 1. Improved Event Structure
**Staked Event (V3):**
```solidity
event Staked(
    address indexed user,
    uint256 indexed stakeIndex,  // ← NEW: Direct stake index
    uint256 planId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 startTime,
    address indexed referrer
);
```

**ReferralBonusClaimed Event (V3):**
```solidity
event ReferralBonusClaimed(
    address indexed referrer,
    address indexed staker,
    uint256 stakeIndex,  // ← NEW: Direct stake index
    uint256 bonusAmount
);
```

### 2. New Helper Functions Available
```solidity
// Get all claimable referral bonuses in one call
function getClaimableReferralBonuses(address _referrer)
    returns (address[] stakers, uint256[] stakeIndexes, uint256[] bonusAmounts)

// Get total claimable amount
function getTotalClaimableReferralAmount(address _referrer)
    returns (uint256)
```

### 3. Referral Commission
- **Default:** 10% (1000 basis points)
- **Adjustable:** Owner can change between 0-10% using `setReferralCommission()`

## 📊 What's Fixed

### ✅ Issue #1: Referral Earnings Showing 0.00
**Root Cause:** Complex event processing and missing stakeIndex
**V3 Fix:** Direct stakeIndex in events + helper functions
**Result:** Accurate claimable amounts displayed

### ✅ Issue #2: Claim Status Not Updating
**Root Cause:** Couldn't match claims to specific stakes
**V3 Fix:** ReferralBonusClaimed event includes stakeIndex
**Result:** Reliable claim status tracking

### ✅ Issue #3: White Page After Wallet Connect
**Root Cause:** Undefined variable reference
**V3 Fix:** Fixed variable names in frontend
**Result:** Page loads smoothly
