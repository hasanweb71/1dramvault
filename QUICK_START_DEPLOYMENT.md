# üöÄ Quick Start Deployment Guide

## Overview
This is a condensed step-by-step guide to deploy the 1Dream Dapps V2 system. For detailed information, see `README_V2_MIGRATION.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.

---

## ‚ö° Prerequisites

- [ ] Node.js installed
- [ ] Hardhat or Truffle set up
- [ ] BSC wallet with BNB for gas
- [ ] 1DREAM tokens for reward pool (100,000+ recommended)
- [ ] Access to Supabase dashboard

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contract (30 min)

```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd contracts/

# Compile contract
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to BSC TESTNET first
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet

# Save the contract address: ________________

# Verify on BSCscan Testnet
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "0x0C98F3e79061E0dB9569cd2574d8aac0d5023965"

# Test thoroughly on testnet (see testing checklist below)

# If testnet works, deploy to BSC MAINNET
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bsc

# Save the contract address: ________________

# Verify on BSCscan Mainnet
npx hardhat verify --network bsc YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "0x0C98F3e79061E0dB9569cd2574d8aac0d5023965"
```

**Contract Address (Update after deployment):**
```
Testnet: _________________________________
Mainnet: _________________________________
```

### Step 2: Initialize Contract (15 min)

```javascript
// Using Hardhat console or script

// 1. Add Flexible Plan (8% APY, No Lock)
await contract.addStakingPlan(
    "Flexible Staking",
    800,  // 8% APY in basis points
    0,    // No lock period
    0,    // No early fee
    ethers.parseEther("100"), // Min 100 1DREAM
    true  // Active
);

// 2. Add 90 Days Plan (15% APY, 90 days, 12% fee)
await contract.addStakingPlan(
    "90 Days Lock",
    1500,
    7776000,  // 90 days in seconds
    1200,     // 12% fee
    ethers.parseEther("500"),
    true
);

// 3. Add 180 Days Plan (25% APY, 180 days, 15% fee)
await contract.addStakingPlan(
    "180 Days Lock",
    2500,
    15552000, // 180 days in seconds
    1500,     // 15% fee
    ethers.parseEther("1000"),
    true
);

// 4. Fund Contract with 1DREAM tokens
// Transfer tokens to contract address
await oneDreamToken.transfer(
    contractAddress,
    ethers.parseEther("100000") // 100k tokens
);

// 5. Verify Contract State
console.log("Plans:", await contract.getStakingPlanCount());
console.log("Balance:", await contract.getContractTokenBalance());
console.log("Commission:", await contract.referralCommissionBasisPoints()); // Should be 500
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Configuration (10 min)

**File: `src/hooks/useStakingData.ts`**

```typescript
// Line ~141: Update this address
const STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_NEW_V2_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';

// Line ~146: Replace entire ABI with contents from:
// contracts/OneDreamStakingV2_ABI.json
const STAKING_CONTRACT_ABI = [ /* paste ABI here */ ];
```

**File: `src/hooks/useReferralData.ts`**

```typescript
// Line ~7: Update this address
const STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_NEW_V2_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';

// Line ~8: Replace entire ABI with contents from:
// contracts/OneDreamStakingV2_ABI.json
const STAKING_CONTRACT_ABI = [ /* paste ABI here */ ];
```

### Step 4: Apply Database Migration (5 min)

```bash
# Backup database first (via Supabase dashboard)

# Apply migration
supabase db push

# Or manually via SQL editor in Supabase dashboard:
# Paste contents of: supabase/migrations/20250930120000_simplify_referral_system_v2.sql
# Run the SQL

# Verify in Supabase dashboard:
# - Table "referral_config" exists
# - Default rate (500) is inserted
# - View "current_referral_rate" shows data
```

### Step 5: Build and Deploy Frontend (10 min)

```bash
# Test locally first
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
# Test: wallet connect, staking, referral display

# If local test works, build for production
npm run build

# Deploy dist/ folder to your hosting
# (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
```

### Step 6: Verify Production (15 min)

Visit your production URL and test:

- [ ] Wallet connects successfully
- [ ] Staking plans show correctly
- [ ] Can approve and stake tokens
- [ ] Referral link generates
- [ ] Commission shows as single percentage (e.g., "5%")
- [ ] Admin panel accessible for owner
- [ ] No console errors

---

## üß™ Quick Testing Checklist

### Contract Tests (Do on Testnet First!)

- [ ] Stake 100 tokens (Flexible plan)
- [ ] Verify stake appears in user stakes
- [ ] Wait 1 minute, claim small reward
- [ ] Unstake (should work, no fee for Flexible)
- [ ] Stake with referral address
- [ ] Verify referral count increased
- [ ] Claim referral bonus (5% of staked amount)
- [ ] Update commission as admin (e.g., to 3%)
- [ ] Verify new stakes use new commission

### Frontend Tests

- [ ] Connect MetaMask/wallet
- [ ] Select staking plan
- [ ] Approve tokens
- [ ] Stake successfully
- [ ] View my stakes
- [ ] Claim rewards
- [ ] Claim referral bonus
- [ ] Admin: Update commission
- [ ] No errors in browser console

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test on testnet first** - Save yourself stress and money
2. **Fund extra for taxes** - 1DREAM has transaction fees, plan accordingly
3. **Monitor balance weekly** - Don't let contract run out of tokens
4. **Keep admin private key VERY safe** - It controls everything
5. **Document everything** - Future you will thank current you
