# Blockchain Migration Complete

## Summary

Your application has been successfully migrated from a hybrid database-blockchain architecture to a **pure blockchain-native application**. All Supabase database dependencies have been removed, and the application now reads all data directly from the smart contract on BSC (Binance Smart Chain).

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dependencies
- **Supabase Client Library**: Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` from package.json
- **Database Files**: Deleted all Supabase migration files and database configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Removed Supabase URL and API key from `.env`

### 2. Refactored Data Layer
- **useReferralData Hook**: Complete rewrite to fetch all data from blockchain
  - Referral tiers now fetched from smart contract
  - User referral statistics retrieved via contract calls
  - Referred stakes queried through blockchain events

### 3. Implemented Browser-Based Caching
- **localStorage Cache**: Replaced Supabase database cache with browser localStorage
- **Cache Keys**:
  - `onedream_referral_tiers` - Stores referral tier configuration
  - `onedream_user_referral_data_[address]` - User-specific referral stats
  - `onedream_referred_stakes_[address]` - Referred stakes by user
- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Stale data is automatically refreshed from blockchain

### 4. Architecture Changes
```
BEFORE:
Blockchain (Source of Truth) ‚Üí Supabase (Cache) ‚Üí React App

AFTER:
Blockchain (Source of Truth) ‚Üí localStorage (Cache) ‚Üí React App
```

---

## How Caching Works

### First Load
1. User opens the app
2. App checks localStorage for cached data
3. No cache found - fetches from blockchain
4. Data is displayed and saved to localStorage with timestamp

### Subsequent Loads (within 5 minutes)
1. User opens the app
2. App checks localStorage and finds valid cache
3. Data is instantly displayed from cache (no RPC calls)
4. Background refresh may occur if cache is close to expiration

### After Cache Expires (5+ minutes)
1. User interacts with the app
2. App detects expired cache
3. Fresh data fetched from blockchain
4. Cache is updated with new data and timestamp

## Performance Characteristics

### Advantages
‚úÖ **No External Database**: Zero database hosting costs
‚úÖ **Fully Decentralized**: No dependency on centralized services
‚úÖ **Instant Loads**: Cached data appears instantly
‚úÖ **Portable**: Works anywhere without server configuration
‚úÖ **Privacy**: User data stored only in their browser

### Trade-offs
‚ö†Ô∏è **Initial Load Slower**: First-time users wait for blockchain queries
‚ö†Ô∏è **Per-Device Cache**: Cache not shared across user's devices
‚ö†Ô∏è **RPC Dependency**: Relies on BSC RPC node availability
‚ö†Ô∏è **Browser Storage Limits**: localStorage has ~5-10MB limit per domain

## Data Flow Examples

### Fetching Referral Tiers
```
1. Check localStorage for 'onedream_referral_tiers'
2. If found and < 5 min old ‚Üí Use cached data
3. If not found or expired:
   a. Call contract.getReferralTierCount()
   b. Loop through tiers calling contract.getReferralTier(i)
   c. Format data and save to localStorage
   d. Display to user
```

### Fetching User Referral Data
```
1. Check localStorage for 'onedream_user_referral_data_[wallet]'
2. If found and < 5 min old ‚Üí Use cached data
3. If not found or expired:
   a. Call contract.getDirectReferralCount(wallet)
   b. Call contract.getReferrerTotalEarnings(wallet)
   c. If referral count > 0:
      - Query blockchain events for Staked events
      - Filter events by referrer address
      - Process each event to get stake details
   d. Save all data to localStorage
   e. Display to user
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Any Server/Host

Your application is now **completely standalone**. To deploy:

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload the `dist` folder** to any static hosting service:
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - GitHub Pages
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Traditional web hosting (Apache, Nginx)
   - IPFS (for fully decentralized hosting)

3. **No environment variables needed**:
   - The `.env` file is now empty (only used during development)
   - All blockchain RPC endpoints are hardcoded in the code
   - No API keys or secrets required

4. **No backend server required**:
   - Pure static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - All logic runs in the user's browser
   - Direct communication with blockchain RPC nodes

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Before Deploying

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Test Cold Start**:
   - Visit app for first time
   - Verify data loads from blockchain
   - Check that loading states work correctly

3. **Test Cached Loads**:
   - Refresh the page immediately
   - Data should appear instantly from localStorage
   - No blockchain queries should occur

4. **Test Cache Expiration**:
   - Wait 6+ minutes
   - Interact with the app
   - Verify fresh data is fetched from blockchain

5. **Test Different Wallets**:
   - Connect different MetaMask accounts
   - Each account should have separate cached data
   - Verify referral data is correct per wallet

---

## Cache Management

### Manual Cache Clear
Users can clear their cache via browser developer tools:

```javascript
// Clear all OneDream cache
localStorage.removeItem('onedream_referral_tiers');
localStorage.removeItem('onedream_user_referral_data_[address]');
localStorage.removeItem('onedream_referred_stakes_[address]');

// Or clear everything
localStorage.clear();
```

### Adjusting Cache Duration

Edit `src/hooks/useReferralData.ts`:

```typescript
// Change this value (currently 5 minutes)
const CACHE_DURATION = 5 * 60 * 1000; // milliseconds

// Examples:
const CACHE_DURATION = 1 * 60 * 1000;  // 1 minute
const CACHE_DURATION = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes
const CACHE_DURATION = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Data Not Loading
**Solution**: Check browser console for RPC errors. BSC public RPC nodes sometimes rate limit.

### Issue: Stale Data Showing
**Solution**: Clear localStorage cache or wait for automatic refresh after 5 minutes.

### Issue: Slow Initial Load
**Solution**: This is expected behavior on first load. Consider adding a loading message.

### Issue: RPC Rate Limiting
**Solution**: The app uses fallback RPC providers automatically. If all fail, try again later.

---

## Future Enhancements

Consider these improvements:

1. **WebSocket Listeners**: Add real-time blockchain event monitoring
2. **IndexedDB**: Switch from localStorage to IndexedDB for larger cache capacity
3. **Service Worker**: Enable offline capability and background cache updates
4. **Progressive Loading**: Show partial data while fetching more
5. **Custom RPC**: Add ability for users to configure their own RPC endpoints

## Questions?

If you need to adjust caching behavior, RPC endpoints, or event query ranges, all configuration is in:
- `src/hooks/useReferralData.ts`
- `src/hooks/useStakingData.ts`
- `src/hooks/useTokenData.ts`

The application is now **100% blockchain-native** with zero external dependencies! üéâ
